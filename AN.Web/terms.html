            <h2>REGISTRATION PROCESS</h2>
            <p>
              In accordance with the provisions of the law governing these
              General Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy, access to the
              AwroNore Services is limited to persons over 18 years of age. If
              you are under 18 we will require you prior to use, expressly, to
              secure authorization in writing from your parents or guardians.
              Therefore, when registering on AwroNore Services, you expressly
              state and ensure that you fulfil this requirement and otherwise
              accept the consequences if they arise. If you are unable to comply
              with the conditions laid down in this paragraph, please do not
              register at AwroNore.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are a HCP, we confirm in accordance with the provisions of
              the law governing these General Terms of Use and the Privacy
              Policy, that access to AwroNore is limited to medical
              professionals who are qualified to meet all of the requirements
              demanded by their profession in the country in which they pursue
              this profession. Therefore, by registering on our website as a
              HCP, you expressly state and guarantee that you meet this
              requirement and accept the consequences that may arise if
              otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              To access to AwroNore Services, we offer Users and HCPs a
              registration system that will manage your personal information and
              create customized access with a mobile number and OTP. If you are
              a User, you can access the registration system through the
              Application once it is installed on your mobile device. HCP can
              only access registration through the Website”.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>HOW DO WE WORK?</h2>
            <p>
              Once registration is completed by the User or the HCP, AwroNore
              works through the Website and through mobile devices where the
              Application has been downloaded and installed. In the case of HCP,
              they may only access via the Website as the Application is
              exclusively for Users. Both the User and the HCP may customize the
              profile by using the Configuration Panel.
            </p>
            <p>
              By registering as a User you will allow AwroNore to use your data
              once it has been dissociated from you, and it cannot be associated
              with you as you always remain anonymous along with the aggregated
              anonymous data from other registered Users. Also, the User
              registration will allow you to synchronize your data in a secure
              environment to make and keep a backup copy so you can store and
              retrieve your data at any time and from any device that lets you
              do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both HCP and Users, through the Website and through the
              Application respectively, may enter, access, modify, correct,
              update, or cancel their profile information and reject the
              processing of their data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, AwroNore provides Users and HCP an intermediary
              service between the two in which, through the Website, the HCP can
              communicate, advice, monitor and access data from Users who have
              invited him/her to be their HCP.

              Existence of file: In compliance with the Organic Law 15/1999 on

              The user may exercise his right to access, rectify, challenge, and

              Obligation to provide information: All data fields on the
              registration form are required for registration. Failure to
              communicate such data makes it impossible for AwroNore to
              determine if the Services offered on the Website can be used by
              the User and the HCP, as it is impossible for the User to use the
              Application as it is intended to be used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purpose and Consent: By voluntarily providing personal data, and
              completing and submitting the registration form for the User and
              HCP, or to use the Services or the Application, and by clicking on
              the corresponding checkbox, the User and the HCP give their
              express consent for Awrosoft to process their personal data in

              Statistics Report: Please note that Awrosoft may use the data
              provided by the Users and HCP through the AwroNore Services in

              statistical reporting to improve our Services. In preparing these
              reports, the data will be in an aggregate form so it will always
              be used anonymously and without any elements that identify the
              User or HCP who provide such data. Therefore no identification
              data such as email account, first name and last name of any User

              Awrosoft with one or more third parties, in order to mine data and
              findings that advance research. Participation in these
              Questionnaires, Surveys and Tests will be entirely voluntary and
              optional. In case you chose to participate in Questionnaires,
              Surveys and Tests, your participation is subject to the General

              organizations who want to do some kind of research or analysis
              activity to improve the lives of people.

            <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>
            <p>
              “Personal Information” for the purposes of this policy means
              information that identifies you, such as your name, address, phone
              number, fax number or email address. We do not consider Personal
              Information to include information that has been anonymized so
              that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific
              individual.
            </p>
            <h4>We collect Personal Information when you:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>communicate with us through customer support</li>
              <li>communicate with us by sending a feature request</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>INFORMATION YOU ELECT TO SHARE WITH OTHERS</h2>
            <p>
              Through the AwroNore Services, you can collect and store
              Health-Related Information, which you can then share with others
              if you chose to do so. Many users find this to be an important
              motivator in achieving their recovery goals. “Health-Related
              Information” for the purpose of this Policy means individually
              identifiable health information, including information related to
              an individual’s physical or mental health or medical records. You
              should be aware that such information is not encrypted when stored
              on your mobile device, and can be read by others if you do not
              take the proper security safeguards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users expressly agree that the HCP will have access to the data
              provided by the AwroNore User in order that their HCP can follow
              up and monitor the User, and can give them the advice they
              consider appropriate for as long as the User decides.
              Consequently, the User expressly authorizes AwroNore to transfer
              the User’s personal data to communicate with their AwroNore HCP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users expressly agree that the HCP will have access to the data
              provided by the AwroNore User in order that their HCP can follow
              up and monitor the User, and can give them the advice they
              consider appropriate for as long as the User decides.
              Consequently, the User expressly authorizes AwroNore to transfer
              the User’s personal data to communicate with their AwroNore HCP.
            </p>
            <p>
              The HCP may only use the User’s data who has selected them as
              their HCP in order to be able to follow up and monitor the User,
              and give the advice they consider most appropriate for the period
              that the User decides. With the acceptance by the HCP of the
              User’s invitation to be their HCP, the HCP is expressly authorized
              for the assignment of personal data for the AwroNore HCP,
              consisting of: e-mail the HCP (which, in any case, this HCP has
              provided to the User prior to the User sending them the invitation
              freely, voluntarily, and optionally without any intervention from
              Awrosoft), their first name and last name, the User who invited
              them to be their HCP and has agreed to be their HCP, for the
              purpose indicated in this paragraph. Users may have as many HCP as
              they want, if, in turn, the HCPs they invite accept their
              invitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In any case, the HCP personal data will not be given or
              transferred by Awroosft/AwroNore to any party other than the User
              who invited them to be Their HCP on the Website, (and whose
              invitation has been accepted), without the express prior consent
              of the HCP personally.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time, the User and the HCP may terminate their relationship
              with AwroNore by using one of the options that is available to
              both in their configuration panels. From that moment that the HCP
              or the User decide to end their relationship through the Website,
              the person that the User designated as their HCP will immediately
              cease to access the data provided by the User to AwroNore, and the
              User will no longer have immediate access to the data stored with
              their HCP in AwroNore. Both the User and the HCP may disengage
              other Users and HCP, respectively, at any time.

            <p>
              We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children
              under 14. If we discover that a child under the age of 14 has
              provided us with personally identifying information, we will take
              steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

            <h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>
            <p>
              Despite the fact that Awrosoft does not process or store the data
              shared by the Users and HCP, the company has applied all the
              measures required for the “high-security-level-files” in order to
              grant the protection of the data and information of the Users and
              HCP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Awrosoft ensures absolute confidentiality and privacy of our Users
              and HCP personal data, and has therefore adopted essential
              security measures to prevent alteration, loss, treatment or
              unauthorized access to guarantee its integrity and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Awrosoft is in no way liable for any incidents that may
              arise with respect to personal data that derive either from an
              attack or unauthorized access to systems that is impossible to
              detect by the security measures implemented.

            <h2>COOKIES</h2>
            <p>
              Our Website uses automatic data collection systems, not directly
              provided by the User and the HCP, such as cookies. Cookies are
              files that are installed on the hard drive of the User’s and the
              HCP computers, or in the memory on the default browser
              pre-configured in the computer’s operating system, to identify
              said User or HCP. While it does not contain intelligible
              information, it associates the User and HCP’s identity with
              personal data that they leave on the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies are located on a AwroNore server so that only Awrosoft can
              process and/or manage the information collected and obtained
              through cookies – and exclusively only anonymously, and aggregated
              in order to optimize the Services of the Website regarding the
              specific requirements and preferences of Users and HCPs expressed
              through their browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
              On entering the AwroNore Website, the User and the HCP are giving
              their consent to install the aforementioned cookies on their hard
              disk. If the User or HCP does not want to install a cookie on
              their hard drive, they must configure their Internet browser
              software in order to disable them.
